Capstone project for Ibukunoluwa Felicity Oguntolu.
Design of a low- cost Electrocardiogram (ECG).
Due to the delicate nature of ECG signals, after analog filtering some post- digital filtering is also required.
The .m file contains the code for obtaining the signal using an auxiliary cable and plot the signal.
It also contains the code fro performing zero- phase filtering and the moving average filter.
The zero- phase filter preserves the QRS complex of the ECG signal and the moving average filter reduces random noise and smoothens the signal.
